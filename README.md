This is Python code for training and testing both mapnet and navigation components.

### Requirements
- Python 3.7
- Torch 0.4.1

#### Python Packages
```
networkx
torchvision 0.2.1
```

### Datasets

#### Active Vision Dataset (AVD)
We used the AVD dataset which can be found [here](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~ammirato/active_vision_dataset_website/). We provide additional required data (such as detections, semantic segmentations, annotated targets etc.) [here](https://cs.gmu.edu/~ggeorgak/ActiveVisionDataset.zip). The file contains a folder "ActiveVisionDataset" that also shows the expected structure of the folders when running the code. In each scene folder (i.e. "Home_001_1") put the "high_res_depth" and "jpg_rgb" folders that can be downloaded fromt the official AVD website. Finally, in parameters.py, update the avd_root path to point to the "ActiveVisionDataset" folder.
The target annotations and the chosen test set were provided by: "Mousavian et al, Visual Representation for Semantic Target Driven Navigation".

Support for Matterport3D is coming soon.


### MapNet Module
The implementation follows the module described in "Henriques et al, MapNet: An Allocentric Spatial Memory for Mapping Environments" along with our own extensions. Run the train_MapNet.py and test_MapNet.py directly for training and testing respectively. Make sure to edit the parameters.py under the ParametersMapNet class first. 

### Navigation Module
The implementation is tailored for imitation learning. The model definition can be found in IL_Net.py. Run train_NavNet.py and test_NavNet.py for training and testing after editing the appropriate parameters in the Parameters_IL class.
